# An introduction to  Interactive Data Visualization with Bokeh
### Level: Beginner

## Project description
Any story would be dead without proper visualizations. During the workshop, you will learn how to explore data visualization with Bokeh and how to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

## Setup
All the required dependencies are specified in the file *requirements.txt*. 
It is easy to create a Python 3 (ana)conda environment named `bokeh_env` and install all the dependencies with the following command:
```conda create --name bokeh_env --file requirements.txt python=3.7```

Then, activate this environment with the command:
```conda activate bokeh_env```

Alternatively, you can install all the dependencies using pip with the following command:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**Note:** Please ensure that you navigate to the directory where the *requirements.txt* file is stored before running either of these commands

## Requirements
* Python 3
* Your Github account
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/). Brush up on your Git knowledge with this [Git ramp up tutorial](https://try.github.io/)
* [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)


## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Navigate to the workshop folder and activate the conda environment using the command: ```conda activate bokeh_env```
* Start [Jupyter Lab](https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab/) with the command `jupyter lab` 

**Note:** We wil be using Jupyter Lab for this workshop. It is also possible to use Jupyter Notebooks with the command `jupyter notebook`.
